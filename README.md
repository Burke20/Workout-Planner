# ABOUT THE APP
This is a **Kotlin** program that creates an workout Planner App for users. I am Creating this app as part of my project for Software Delopement tools For My SSD course in SETU Waterford. We are assigned to create an App of our own choice. I decided that a Workout app would be a good idea to included everything we have learned.

## Why is this project Useful?
The notes App I have Created HAs been worked on to be a great App for anyone who Is wanting to Create a Personalised Workout App. The app allows users to create a new workout. Add Exercises, Delete these Workout Plans, personalise them by updating them and List out each workout that they choose.

The App, asmentioned above, takes into account the User Experience first and foremost, and also Developer Experience for anyone who would like to work on this project at a later Date. The app is Fully functional with CRUD and is working to its best at the moment but There is Plenty of room for new features and extensions in the future!
